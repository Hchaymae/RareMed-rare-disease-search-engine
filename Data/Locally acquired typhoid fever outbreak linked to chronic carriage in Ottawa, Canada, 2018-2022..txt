infections are uncommon and typically travel-related In November Ottawa Public Health identified a link between two Affiliations typhoid fever cases with no recent history of international travel to the same grocery store ready-to-eat counter Canadian Field Epidemiology Program Public Health Agency of Canada Ottawa ON Objective: This report describes the outbreak response to a rare occurrence of chronic S Typhi carriage in Ottawa Ontario Canada and provides recommendations for investigations of Ottawa Public Health Ottawa ON small-scale protracted outbreaks Public Health Ontario Toronto ON Methods: We administered exposure questionnaires using a single interviewer approach The Ottawa Hospital Ottawa ON tested stool samples of contacts and food handlers inspected food premises collected food samples and reviewed takeout receipts Social network spatial and whole genome sequencing analyses were used to investigate additional possible links between cases *Correspondence: jacquelinewillmore@ottawaca Results: Seven people with typhoid fever and onset from October to May were linked to an asymptomatic chronic S Typhi carrier Whole-genome sequencing confirmed that all eight isolates matched the outbreak cluster All cases and carrier resided within an eight km radius in Ottawa The chronic carrier worked as a food handler at various locations of a grocery store chain including the implicated ready-to-eat counter Transmission occurred via food handling shared workspaces and social and household networks Conclusion: The chronic carrier was excluded from food handling until successful completion of treatment and clearance testing We overcame the challenges of a small but prolonged outbreak by identifying an asymptomatic carrier using a multi-method approach including whole genome sequencing and social network analysis Suggested citation: Zhang J Jolly A Nguyen T Taha M Lee C Corbeil A Dapaah E Walker J Cooper C Willmore J Locally acquired

the identification of the two index typhoid They were contacted to gather information and request stool fever cases (cases D and E) in November laboratory testing Stool cultures came back positive for S Typhi They were investigations identified two additional cases (cases B and C) asymptomatic and reported no prior history of gastrointestinal or clustering by WGS with illness onset of October and biliary tract illness November respectively (Figure ) Of these four initial cases three (cases B D and E) had an epidemiological link Epidemiological evidence strongly suggested that to the same grocery store ready-to-eat-counter as either case A (carrier) was the source case for the outbreak as there customers (cases B and D) or an employee (case E) At that time were epidemiological links to all cases Cases B D E and H an exposure could not be established for case C Given the long were linked via two grocery store chain locations Social network intervals between case illnesses and

complex (however source of transmission was a food handler with chronic S Typhi with no known direct contact) and with cases F and G as social carriage Therefore the initial outbreak investigation focused on or household contacts (Figure ) Further laboratory evidence the ready-to-eat counter revealed that all eight outbreak-related S Typhi isolates were closely related within seven alleles by

challenges an employee due to employment across multiple locations of of identifying and managing a typhoid fever outbreak as well as the grocery store chain In typhoid fever investigations given the strengths of using multiple epidemiological laboratory and the potential long period of exposure and transient food handler environmental investigation methods during outbreak responses workforce we recommend taking an extensive employment history of past present and temporary food handlers The Characteristics of this outbreak are similar to others reported exclusion from work for typhoid fever treatment and clearance from non-endemic high-income countries () Locally acquired also caused financial hardship to the food handlers The negative typhoid fever outbreaks reported in the United States since impacts of excluding infected persons from work duties is likely the 1960s had limited secondary transmission and were often to be shared within social networks thus discouraging further

those on medically mandated leave such of the challenges noted in these previous investigations First as that made available due to COVID- illness presents a outbreaks caused by chronic S Typhi carriage may be difficult to potential mechanism to facilitate employment insurance for other detect as carriers can shed bacteria intermittently for many years notifiable infections requiring exclusion from work () potentially causing infections over a long period of time () Second a small number of cases and long incubation period Although there was no known direct contact shared bathrooms can make it more challenging to generate source hypotheses or shared meals between case A (carrier) and case C (neighbour) Finally given that typhoid fever cases have become infrequent in we hypothesize that transmission potentially occurred through non-endemic countries public health representatives may have fomite contamination of common surfaces such as doorknobs limited experience managing such outbreaks () railings or elevators Likewise although case H (the janitor) did not have known direct contact with case A or eat meals at the This outbreak was difficult to identify due to the span of multiple ready-to-eat counter we hypothesize that acquisition likely years between cases While the first clinical case was reported occurred via common surfaces used by case A (carrier) at
