Br HeartJ ; : - Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in healthy teenage boys D F DICKINSON OLIVE SCOTT From the Department ofPaediatric Cardiology Killingbeck Hospital Leeds SUMMARY Ambulatory monitoring of the electrocardiogram in healthy to year old boys showed heart rates ranging from to beats/minute during the day and from to beats/ minute during sleep Sinus arrhythmia was present in all cases and was the only variation noted in % Sudden variations in the PP interval occurred in % but a precise diagnosis of the mechan- ism was usually impossible; % had changes compatible with sinus arrest or temporary complete sinoatrial block and one boy had a pattern compatible with type II second degree sinoatrial block Escape rhythms were noted in % first degree atrioventricular block in % and second degree atrioventricular block (Mobitz type I) in % Mobitz type II second degree atrioventricular block was seen on one occasion in one boy Ventricular extrasystoles seen in % were of uniform morphology in % and multiform in % Short episodes of ventricular tachycardia were recorded in % The use of hour recordings of the electrocardiog- activities during the period of recording and noted ram is now well established in the investigation of these activities in a diary An Oxford medical systems symptomatic individuals suspected of having a cardiac analyser was used for analysis All abnormalities were arrhythmia In the paediatric age group many recorded and routine printouts were obtained for patients investigated in this way have no symptoms seconds every four hours even when no
