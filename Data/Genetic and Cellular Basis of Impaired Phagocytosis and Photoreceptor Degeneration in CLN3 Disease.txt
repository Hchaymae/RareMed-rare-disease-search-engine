Ophthalmol Vis Sci blotting and immunohistochemistry Electroretinogram optical coherence tomography ;(): and histological analysis of CLN3–/– and wild-type miniswine eyes were carried out https://doiorg//iovs at or months of age RESULTS CLN3–/– RPE (CLN3 RPE) displayed decreased POS binding and consequently decreased uptake of POS compared with isogenic control RPE cells Furthermore wild-type miniswine RPE cells phagocytosed CLN3–/– POS less efficiently than wild-type POS Consistent with decreased POS phagocytosis lipofus- cin/autofluorescence was decreased in CLN3 miniswine RPE at months of age and was followed by almost complete loss of photoreceptors at months of age CONCLUSIONS CLN3–/– mutation (which affects ≤% of patients) affects both RPE and POS and leads to photoreceptor cell loss in CLN3 disease Furthermore both primary RPE dysfunction and mutant POS independently contribute to impaired POS phagocytosis in CLN3 disease Keywords: CLN3 disease

sufficient to promote reduced POS binding and consequently defective POS phagocytosis by CLN3 disease RPE cells CLN3 Mutant POS are Phagocytosed Less Efficiently by WT RPE Cells Our published paper22 and the results presented in this study (Figs ) show that disease-causing CLN3 mutation leads to impaired POS phagocytosis by RPE cells However these data lack the consideration of diseased POS to the phagocytosis process Note that POS disorganization is an early pathological hallmark of CLN3 disease retina in living human eye Furthermore several studies have impli- cated inflammation and oxidative stress in CLN3 disease55– and it has been shown previously that oxidized POS and POS exposed to free radicals are phagocytosed less efficiently by RPE cells Therefore we next investigated the phagocy- tosis of control vs CLN3 mutant POS We chose to use CLN3 mutant POS isolated from CLN3–/– Yucatan miniswine in these experiments because it is well-established that POS in stem cell-derived retina organoids lack reproducibility and consistency poten- tially owing to the lack of RPE Parallel cultures of WT miniswine primary RPE were fed either unlabeled WT miniswine POS or CLN3 miniswine POS (approxi- mately POS/RPE cell) for hours (Figs 4a 4b) Subse- quently phagocytosis of POS was measured by quantitative Western blotting analyses measuring the levels of RHO a POS-specific protein within the WT miniswine RPE cells CLN3 miniswine POS were phagocytosed less effi- ciently by WT miniswine RPE cultures compared with WT miniswine POS (Figs 4c 4d) In fact WT miniswine POS were phagocytosed greater than five-fold more efficiently than the CLN3 miniswine POS (Figs 4c 4d) These data suggest that CLN3-mutant POS contribute to defective POS phagocytosis by RPE cells in CLN3 disease Decreased POS Phagocytosis and Subsequent Decrease in Autofluorescence/Lipofuscin Levels Precedes Loss of the Outer Nuclear Layer (ONL) in the CLN3 Miniswine Model To validate POS phagocytosis
