Zheng et al BMC Neurology () : BMC Neurology https://doiorg//s12883--- CASE REPORT Open Access Holocord syringomyelia caused by tethered cord syndrome: case report and literature review Longtao Zheng1 Zhangzheng Liao1 and Hongzhou Duan1* Abstract Background Syringomyelia is a rare disease with diverse etiologies and the syrinx is typically confined to certain segments of the spinal cord Case of syringomyelia affecting the whole cord due to tethered cord is extremely rare and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood Case presentation We described an -year-old male patient who presented with progressive weakness in both lower extremities and bladder dysfunction over the past four years Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the entire spine revealed a tethered spinal cord with a large syrinx extending from C1 to L5 Common causes of syr- inx such as Chiari malformation intramedullary tumors and spinal cord injury were systematically ruled out leading to a strong suspicion that the tethered cord was the primary etiology of the extensive syringomyelia After undergo- ing un-tethering surgery the patient experienced significant symptomatic improvement and the subsequent follow- up MRI examinations demonstrated a remarkable reduction and eventual resolution of the large syrinx Conclusions Although rare tethered cord syndrome can serve as the sole etiology for extensive syringomyelia For such patients performing un-tethering surgery can lead to complete resolution of the syrinx and achieve a satis- factory clinical outcome Keywords

Neurology () : Page of four years Initially four years prior the patient sought no treatment was initiated at that time Over the past medical assistance at a local hospital due to weakness four years the patient experienced a gradual worsening predominantly in the right lower limb which was accom- of weakness in both lower limbs along with right lower panied by mild varus deformity of the right foot A lum- back pain frequent urination and incomplete bladder bar MRI scan was performed showing a low-lying conus emptying without any other sphincter control issues or medullaris at the L5-S1 level and a tethered cord along erectile dysfunction Upon presentation in our hospi- with a syrinx extending from L1 to L5 (Fig ) However tal a physical examination revealed an abnormal gait this finding was erroneously interpreted as normal and an elevated arch and varus deformity of the right foot although there was no abnormal sensory perception in the lower limbs Muscle strength was assessed as grade V in the upper limbs and grade IV in the lower limbs A comprehensive spinal MRI confirmed the low position of the conus medullaris tethered spinal cord and a syr- inx extending from C1 to L5 without evidence of Chiari malformation spinal lipoma or other lesions (Fig ) An ultrasound examination of the urinary system indicated the presence of multiple diverticula in the bladder with a residual urine volume of mL After ruling out other potential causes tethered spinal cord was suspected to be the primary etiology of the holocord syrinx leading to the decision to perform untethering surgery Based on preoperative spinal positioning we performed an L5-S1 laminectomy and cut open the dure mater from L5 to S1 A low-lying conus medullaris at the L5-S1 level was con- firmed along with a significantly enlarged cystic filum terminale approximately mm in diameter exhibit- ing increased tension The filum was found to be adher- ent to several surrounding cauda equina nerves After being freed completely and confirmed by an intraopera- Fig tive neurophysiological monitoring the filum terminale Four years before admission the local hospital’s lumbar T2 MRI revealed a low-lying conus medullaris positioned at the L5-S1 level was cut at the S1 level revealing a hollow structure with accompanied by a tethered cord and a syrinx extending from L1 to L5 numerous fibrous partitions A stream of high-tension Fig MRI examinations performed after admission further confirmed the low position of the conus medullaris at L5-S1 the tethered spinal cord and the presence of a

subsequently suggesting a potential communication between the cystic cavity of the filum and the syrinx As the filum was cut and the cystic cavity was open the patient also had an equivalent of a terminal ventriculostomy which was first described by Gandner [] Postoperatively the patient reported significant relief from lower back pain and blad- der dysfunction with an improvement in the strength of both lower limbs A spinal lumbar MRI conducted five days post-surgery demonstrated a significant reduc- tion in the size of the syrinx (Fig ) The patient exhib- ited satisfactory recovery and attended regular follow-up appointments during which whole spine MRI examina- tions at three months and one year (Fig ) postopera- tively indicated complete resolution of the syrinx In the most recent one-year follow-up the patient reported no additional discomfort aside from persistent abnormal gait and varus deformity of the right foot Discussion and conclusions Syringomyelia is an uncommon disease characterized by the formation of abnormal fluid-filled syrinx within the spinal cord The association between syringomyelia and tethered cord syndrome (TCS) has been documented extensively in the literature [ ] A retrospective study conducted by Erkan involving patients diagnosed with TCS revealed that patients (%) exhibited syrin- gomyelia as assessed through MRI [] Additionally in a cohort of patients with occult spinal dysraphism Fig One year follow-up MRI examinations showed complete resolution of the syrinx A lumbar sagittal T1 image; B cervical sagittal T2 image; C thoracic sagittal T2 image; D lumbar sagittal T2 image out of patients (%) were also found to have syringo- myelia [] While the correlation between syringomyelia and TCS is well-documented the underlying pathogenesis linking these two conditions remains incompletely understood Various hypotheses have been proposed to elucidate the etiology and pathophysiology of syringomyelia Initial observations indicated that dilation of the central canal and obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation occur in the early stages of syringomyelia One hypoth- Fig esis posits that atrophy of the spinal cord parenchyma Five days post-operation lumbar sagittal T2 MRI demonstrated a significant reduction in the size of the syrinx leads to central canal dilation which compresses the Zheng
