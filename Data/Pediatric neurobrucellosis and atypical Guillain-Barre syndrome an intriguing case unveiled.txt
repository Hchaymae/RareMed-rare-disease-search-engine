neurobrucellosis a rare complication We report a case of polyradiculoneuropathy in a pediatric patient resulting from this uncommon presentation A -year-old girl presented with progressive asymmetric lower limb weakness for two weeks that progressed to a loss of ambulation in four weeks She also had flu-like symptoms and persistent high- grade fever Her history was notable for ingesting raw milk before the onset of fever Initial examination revealed meningismus signs and fever She had bilateral weak hip flexion graded / on the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale weak right and left knee flexion (/ and / respectively) and weak right ankle dorsiflexion (/) She also had diminished reflexes throughout The patient exhibited a clinical picture resembling Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) after admission as her weakness progressed Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed no cell counts elevated protein levels ( mg/dL) and normal glucose levels ( mmol/L) Blood and CSF cultures were negative but the serum antibody titer was elevated at : against Brucella melitensis and Brucella abortus species Lumbosacral MRI showed diffuse enhancement of the lower nerve roots A nerve conduction study (NCS) demonstrated axonal and demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy The patient regained her strength three months after presentation fol- lowing a course of antibiotics When evaluating patients with atypical manifestations resembling GBS brucellosis should be considered an important differential diagnosis in endemic areas KEYWORDS: Brucella neurobrucellosis polyradiculoneuropathy meningitis
