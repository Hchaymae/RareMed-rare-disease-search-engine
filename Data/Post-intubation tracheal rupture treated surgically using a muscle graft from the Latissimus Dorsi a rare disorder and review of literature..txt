Introduction: Post-intubation tracheal rupture (PiTR) is an extremely uncommon disorder Pneumothorax pneumomediastinum hemorrhage cutaneous emphysema and sepsis are common clinical presentations that eventually result in organ failure and mediastinitis Endoscopy and computed tomography (CT) are considered the gold standards for assessment and diagnosis Case presentation: Here the authors present a -year-old woman with asthma and ischemic heart disease presented to the Emergency Department with dyspnea following viral pneumonia Despite initial treatment her condition worsened requiring tracheal intubation Subsequent complications led to a diagnosis of tracheal rupture requiring surgical repair The procedure involved using a muscle graft from the Latissimus Dorsi muscle: which is a novel Surgical Technique as the authors have conducted a literature review Discussion: Upon scrutinizing analogous cases delineated within the medical literature it becomes evident that our patient manifests four distinct risk factors These factors include gender advanced age asthma and prolonged steroid use While the clinical manifestation and diagnostic methods for tracheal rupture are frequently consistent throughout cases there is a significant variation in the surgical treatments used to treat the condition Conclusion: More research should be conducted to investigate the use of muscle grafts as a treatment technique for tracheal rupture in the future Keywords: asthma case report tracheal rupture Introduction HIGHLIGHTS Orotracheal intubation is the most prevalent cause of
