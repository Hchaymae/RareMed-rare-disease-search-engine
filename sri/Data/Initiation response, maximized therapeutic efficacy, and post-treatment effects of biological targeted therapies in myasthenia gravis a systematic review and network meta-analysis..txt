response metaanalysis Introduction investigating the initial response maximized therapeutic efficacy and posttreatment effects of these drugs Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease characterized by muscle weakness which can progress to an emergent life threatening condition called myasthenic crisis () Although most Methods patients respond to traditional immunosuppressants around  of patients remain unresponsive as their symptoms persist after different Search strategy treatments () Furthermore the side effects of traditional immunosuppressant drugs also deter patients from taking them We conducted a thorough search of several databases including regularly () Around – of MG patients may experience PubMed Web of Science the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled relapses () All of the above challenges contribute to a heavy disease Trials (CENTRAL) and ClinicalTrialsgov to identify randomized burden on MG patients () controlled trials of targeted therapies for MG The search was carried In the recent decade innovative biological targeted drugs have out from the inception of databases to January 20th (Figure ) A been developed to address these unmet needs These targeted combination of search strings was used to filter related studies including drugs are designed based on the underlying pathogenesis ‘myasthenia’ combined with ‘blind’ or ‘randomized’ [“myasthenia” AND mechanism of MG The pathogenic autoantibodies of MG (‟blind” OR ‟randomized”)] To ensure accuracy three reviewers (HZ target essential protein components of the postsynaptic membrane ZL and XL) searched and screened the eligible studies independently at the neuromuscular junction including acetylcholine receptor and any inconsistencies were resolved by consulting a fourth reviewer (AChR) musclespecific kinase (MuSK) and lowdensity (SL) Additionally the references for the included fulltext articles and lipoprotein receptorrelated protein (LRP4) () Double relevant systematic reviews were also screened seronegative MG is also observed in approximately  generalized MG and  ocular MG () Autoreactive B and T cells interact each other and contribute to the production of Abs which block the AChR binding site promote AChR internalization and degradation or activate the classical complement pathway leading to membrane attack complex (MAC) formation and resulting in postsynaptic membrane damage () These novel biological agents including neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) inhibitors (for antibody clearance) complement inhibitors (inhibiting MAC formation at the neuromuscular junctions) and B cell inhibitors (reducing autoantibodyproducing B cells) have been developed to target these mechanisms However there is currently no head tohead comparison study of these agents In the completed randomized controlled trial studies so far changes in MG Activities of Daily Living (MGADL) or Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (MGQMG) relative to baseline have been adopted as either primary or secondary study endpoints rendering them relatively comparable Several meta analyses have been conducted to compare the efficacy of these innovative drugs (–) While similar safety results were achieved different conclusions were made regarding efficacy We believe this could be explained by the variations in the clinical trial data and the different regimens used in these trials For example some drugs were administered persistently during the trial [eg Eculizumab ()] while others were stopped several months before the trial ended [eg Belimumab ()] Hence it would be difficult to draw conclusions when only efficacy at the end of trials was compared Additionally different dosage groups Workflow of article screening Twelve articles of phase IIIII targeted made it imprecise to consider the efficacy of all groups as drugs for myasthenia gravis (MG) were screened from relevant representative of one drug [eg Zilucoplan ()] articles The efficacies of nine drugs (Efgartigimod Nipocalimab Eculizumab Ravulizumab Belimumab Rituximab Rozanolixizumab We conducted a metaanalysis to address the issues related to the innovative targeted drugs used in MG treatment Our analysis focused on the common time points in the regimen design of each trial Frontiers in Neurology frontiersinorg Zhong et al fneur Eligibility criteria Statistical analysis We conducted a metaanalysis of targeted drug trials in MG using This systematic review and network metaanalysis were reported a common twostage study design (treatmentobservation) ( ) according to the

them five were phase II and seven were phase III In needed The MGQMG scale was introduced in and has become total nine targeted drugs were compared in this network meta one of the most widely used
