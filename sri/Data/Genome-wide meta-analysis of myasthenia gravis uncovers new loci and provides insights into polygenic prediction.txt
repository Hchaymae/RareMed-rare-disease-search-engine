Genome-wide meta-analysis of myasthenia gravis uncovers new loci and provides insights into polygenic prediction Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare autoantibody-mediated disease affecting the neuromuscular junction We performed a genome-wide association study of MG cases and controls of European ancestry and a replication study in cases and controls provided by 23andMe Inc We identified independent genome-wide significant hits (P < 5e−) across loci Subgroup analyses revealed two of these were associated with early-onset (at age <) and four with late-onset MG (at age ≥ ) Imputation of human leukocyte antigen alleles revealed inverse effect sizes for late- and early-onset suggesting a potential modulatory influence on the time of disease manifes- tation We assessed the performance of polygenic risk scores for MG which significantly predicted disease status in an independent target cohort explaining % of the phenotypic variation (P = 12e−) With this work we aim to enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of MG Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease of the neuromus- (AChR-Ab) found in % of patients along with muscle-specific tyr- cular junction with a prevalence of approximately per osine kinase (MuSK-Ab) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related individuals1 Its core characteristics include muscle weakness and protein (LRP4-Ab) serve as diagnostic markers for MG However fatigue after physical activity with some patients experiencing around % of patients do not show evidence of any known MG respiratory failure during acute symptom exacerbation2 Auto- antibody3 MG is frequently categorized into early-onset (EOMG; < antibodies directed against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor years old at disease manifestation) and late-onset (LOMG; ≥ years Old at disease manifestation) due to variations in symptom spectrums such as a higher prevalence of thymic hyperplasia in EOMG5To date no large-scale twin studies of MG have been conducted but previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have estimated the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based heritability to be around % While approximately % of patients have a family history ofMG %of cases report having relatives diagnosedwith other autoimmune diseasesPrevious GWAS ofMG have identified genetic loci at theMHC andclose to PTPN22 CHRNA1 CTLA4 SFMBT2 FAM76B and TNFRSF11A Variants specific to EOMG were identified near TNIP1 and LINC02151 while variants at ZBTB10 were exclusively associated with LOMG13 MG has been linked to multiple human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles that play a crucial role in immune function6– as well as to elevated complement system activation particularly in AChR-Ab positive patients Understanding the genetic architecture ofMG can provide crucial insights into pathogenesis which may aid in identifying individuals at risk and facilitate drug development efforts Here we present a comprehensive genetic analysis of MG which includes a GWAS meta-analysis utilizing data from cohorts and a replication sample prvided Results Genome-wide association study of MG We performed a GWAS meta-analysis of MG cases and controls of European ancestry (effective nhalf = ) and SNPs Individual-level genotype data was available for cases This discovery GWAS had a λGC of and an LDSC intercept of indicating that a polygenic signal was themain source of inflation The GWAS identified nine genome-wide significant index SNPs across eight loci and index SNPs below a P-value of 1e− (Supplementary Figs Seven additional loci reached

discovery GWAS leave-one-out GWAS and previous publications in a 23andMe MG cohort of cases and controls Overall we identified independent genome-wide significant SNPs (P < 5e−) through the combined meta-analysis of discovery and replication GWAS including six novel associations (Table Fig 1a) Furthermore all seven index SNPs between P < 1e− and P > 5e− in the discovery and replication

cohorts restricted to AChR-Ab-positive MG cases (n = ) and ICD-based cohorts potentially incorporating patients from other antibody-mediated MG or seronegative cases Notably for the reported index SNPs we found no significant differences in effect sizes between these two data sources except for the MHC locus (Supplementary Fig ) Genome-wide association study of early-onset MG We additionally
