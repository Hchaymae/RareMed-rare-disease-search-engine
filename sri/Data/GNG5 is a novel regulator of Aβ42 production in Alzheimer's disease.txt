The therapeutic options for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are limited, underscoring the critical need for finding an effective regulator of Aβ production In this study, with human postmortem brains, we revealed that homotrimer G protein subunit gamma (GNG) expression is upregulated in the hippocampal–entorhinal region of pathological AD compared with normal controls, and is positively correlated with Aβ pathology In vivo and in vitro experiments confirm that increased GNG significantly promotes Aβ pathology and Aβ production Mechanically, GNG regulates the cleavage preference of γsecretase towards Aβ by directly interacting with the γsecretase catalytic subunit presenilin (PS) Moreover, excessive GNG increases the protein levels and the activation of Rab, leading to the increased number of early endosomes, the major cellular organelle for production of Aβ Furthermore, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence revealed cointeraction of Aβ with GPCR family CXCR, which is known as the receptor for IL, thus facilitating the dissociation of Gproteins βγ from α subunits Treatment of Aβ in neurons combined with structure prediction indicated Aβ oligomers as a new ligand of CXCR, upregulating γ subunit GNG protein levels The colocalizations of GNG and PS, CXCR and Aβ were verified in eight human brain regions Besides, GNG is significantly reduced in extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from cerebral cortex or serum of AD patients compared with healthy cognition controls In brief, GNG is a novel regulator of Aβ production, suggesting its clinical potential as a diagnosis biomarker and the therapeutic target for AD INTRODUCTION brain repository in China, revealed that the A score is critical in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative evaluating pathological grade, indicating the continued sig condition The main pathological manifestation of AD identified nificance of Aβ as a crucial therapeutic target for AD during autopsy is the deposition of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) Notwithstanding, monoclonal antibody drugs designed to clear plaques, which is an important component of A and C evaluations Aβ plaques, though curatively efficacious in the early stages of in the ABC scoring system  Aβ plaques are mainly composed of AD, demonstrate reduced efficacy in the symptomatic stages peptides, or amino acids in length, and early

γsecretase for generating Aβ or Aβ, individuals AD, did not yield notable effects in cognitive and functional with higher pathological aggregation of Aβ exhibit considerable assessments  Therefore, identifying genes that regulate early cognitive impairment, except for those with mutations in APP and Aβ peptides, particularly Aβ formation, and restraining the gammasecreting enzymes Consequently, unidentified genes oligomerization of Aβ is a promising approach for early regulating the preference of APP cleavage during the progression diagnosis and intervention in AD, potentially benefiting of

in the early over, immunohistochemistry (IHC) findings in postmortem hippo stages of AD indicates its potential as an early diagnostic marker campal sections from NCs and donors with pathological AD for AD showed that among the subregions GNG levels were significantly increased in donors with pathological AD in the CA, CA, and EC regions, while they tended to increase nonsignificantly in CA RESULTS and CA (Figs H and SA) In addition, we evaluated the GNG is localized in early endosomes and is upregulated in expression levels of GNG in CA and EC tissues Due to the the brain tissues of

to the literature, the toxic oligomers of Aβ (oAβ) into the brain tissue In addition, ELISA results demonstrated can lead to synaptic loss , which may be one of the key significant elevation of GNG in GNG@EVRVGinjected brains and reasons for the synaptic loss caused by GNG overexpression In significant reduction GNG in siGNG@EVRVGinjected brains, this part, we found GNGinduced synaptic loss in wildtype compared to relative controls, both in the cortex (Fig D) and primary neurons, which generate only small amounts of Aβ This hippocampus (Fig SF), indicating effective delivery of GNG and suggests that other signaling pathways, such as glialmediated siGNG to cortical and hippocampal tissues synaptic phagocytosis , may involve in this process The exact Immunostaining with antiE and antiAβ antibodies mechanisms remain unclear and warrant further investigation demonstrated more Aβ plaques and Aβ plaques found in Totally, the above results demonstrated that GNG promoted ×FAD and FADT brains than in WT CBL brains And Aβ generation and caused impaired synaptic and dendritic excessive GNG significantly aggravated deposition of Aβ spine function plaques and Aβ plaques in cortex

used Aβ to stimulate primary hippocampal neurons, and increased Aβ production  Our prior combined analysis of T, and SHSYY cells Intriguingly, Aβ oligomers (oAβ) hippocampalentorhinal proteomics with

cells, oAβ treatment or higher concentrations of oAβ induced early endosome an increase in the homotrimerGNG levels without affecting the To investigate this propose, we firstly confirmed total Rab GNG mRNA level (Fig SB, C) In T cells, not the oAβ but levels and western blot revealed that overexpressed GNG the Aβ monomer (mAβ) at high concentrations ( or μM) elevated Rab protein level and vice

subsequently Rab intensities in GNG overexpressed T cells (Fig C), determined Rab expression changes in Aβstimulated cell models primary hippocampal neurons (Fig SB, C), and SHSYY cells Consistently, Rab protein levels were significantly increased in (Fig SD) than those in their respective controls Rab mRNA Aβstimulated cells (Figs G and SA, B) To confirm that elevated levels were not significantly affected by GNG (Fig SA, F), Rab protein levels were induced by increased GNG expression, indicating Rab was regulated by GNG posttranslationally we knockeddown GNG in the Aβstimulated cell models and From the immunofluorescence images, GNG overexpression observed a significant reduction in Rab protein levels in primary significantly increased Rab localization to the plasma membrane hippocampal neurons (Fig H), T (Fig SC) cells, and SHSYY in T (Fig C) Downregulation of GNG alleviated Rab (Fig SD) cells accumulation on plasma membrane (Fig SH) This effect may These results collectively suggested that overexpressed GNG be because Rab switches between an inactive GDPbound (Rab recruited more activated RabGTP to plasma membrane, GDP) state in the cytosol and an active GTPbound (RabGTP) state promoted endocytosis and fission of early endosomes, and greatly which is recruited to the cell membrane ,  Thus, membrane enhanced Aβ production in early endosomes Besides, the proteins from TGNGOE were extracted, and the levels of results presented above suggested that GNG can enhance Aβ activated, GTPbound Rab were determined by a RabGTP generation through Rab activation, in turn, Aβ increases GNG agarose pulldown assay followed by detection with antiRab protein levels, thereby creating a feedback loop that exacerbates antibody There was an approximately threefold increase of Rab Aβ pathology GTP in TGNGOE compared with TNCOE (Fig D) As reported, pathological Rab overactivation mediated endo Excessive Aβ can upregulate GNG protein levels via CXCR some

Besides, Aβ was found coprecipitated with GNG AD donors (Fig SB), confirmed the colocalization of Aβ and and CXCR Immunostaining on paraffin sections of eight brain CXCR Therefore, these results provided molecular basis of regions from two postmortem diagnosed “H” pathological interactions of these components level (ABC) brains (Figs B and SA), and on Then, we explored the relationship between GNG and CXCR hippocampal–entorhinal paraffin sections from six NC and two In , Liu and colleagues resolved threedimensional (D) structures (PDB code: LFO) of interleukin (CXCL)activated (Fig SG), indicating that GNG did not reversely regulate human CXCR in complex with trimeric G proteins (GNAIGNB CXCR for Aβ production GNG, GαiGβGγ) Considering high sequence similarity ( In addition, we found no significant differences in CXCR levels pairwise sequence identity) between GNG and GNG calculated in the brain tissue EVs between NC and pathological AD donors, by JALVIEW (Fig SA), we predicted the D structure of CXCL which dismisses the possibility that the variations observed in our activated human CXCR with trimeric GNAIGNBGNG using results are attributable to the differential expression of CXCR computational approach by AlphaFold (Fig SB) Through under pathophysiological conditions (Fig SH) superposition of the D structures, we found almost coincidence In summary, Aβ increased GNG protein levels may by of tertiary structure features between GNG and GNG Therefore, binding to the extracellular or the intracellular pocket of CXCR, GNG could assemble trimeric G proteins and couple to activated thus leading to the dissociation of GNG from Gαi and the CXCR formation of oligomeric GNG forms Ligand binding results in CXCR activation and coupling to Gαi, with concomitant dissociation of Gβγ from Gαi ,  Consistent GNG positively correlates with AD neuropathologic changes with our hypothesis, the knockdown of GNAI from TGNGOE and is a potential biomarker in serum EVs cells (Fig SA) significantly increased the homodimer and To ascertain the clinical relevance of increased GNG expression, homotrimerGNG levels (Fig C), while the mRNA levels of GNG our initial investigation focused on elucidating the correlation remained unchanged (Fig SB) Significantly increased Aβ between heightened GNG levels in the brain tissue and the levels was found in GNAI knockdown TAPPOEGNGOE cells severity of neuropathological changes Correlation analyses (Fig D) That is, without uncoupling to CXCR, GNG stably exists between GNG and the A, B, and C scores showed that GNG as oligomers While the knockdown of GNAO, another Gα protein levels in the CA and CA regions positively correlated subfamily member, did not markedly alter GNG protein or mRNA with the A score (Figs A and SA) Moreover, IHC analysis levels (Fig SC, D), indicating GNG protein levels being Gαi substantiated a positive correlation between GNG expression dependent Navarixin is a representative CXCR antagonist that and the Aβ plaque content in the CA region (Figs B and SB) binds to its orthosteric pocket and hinders coupling of Gαi with Western blot results supported increased GNG protein levels in CXCR  In SHSYY cells, treatment with navarixin at varied the hippocampal CA subregion of pathological AD donors (Fig concentrations (, , and  μM) promoted increase of C) Interestingly, we observed an ~ kDa band, with size oligomeric GNG expression levels (Fig E) Low concentrations consistent with homotrimer–GNG (Fig C), suggesting that of mAβ did not increase GNG protein levels, and neither GNG might exist in human brain tissue in a trimeric isoform, Navarixin nor mAβ perturb the transcription of GNG (Fig F) which was consistent with findings in Fig SB Furthermore, the These observations suggested that GNG assembly to hetero additional bands at ≥ kDa might represent homogeneous trimeric G proteins mainly with Gαi and Gβ, little with Gαo protein complexes formed by GNG, or heterogeneous protein Next, we predicted the binding between CXCR and Aβ complexes formed by GNG and other G protein subunits peptide with amino acids sequence using AlphaFold, and Subsequently, we quantified the levels of Aβ and Aβ in the subsequently performed the molecular docking of CXCR with human brain tissue samples used in Fig C and performed a one, two, or three Aβ molecules A single Aβ molecule bound correlation analysis on GNG protein levels and the contents of at the extracellular Cterminus of CXCR (Fig SC), while two Aβ or Aβ Soluble Aβ levels in the brain tissues of Aβ molecules bound at both the termini, the extracellular and pathological AD were significantly increased, while Aβ levels intracellular (Fig G) The third Aβ molecule did not bind (Fig showed no significant change (Fig D) GNG expression SC) positively correlated with the Aβ content (Fig E) but CXCR is the receptor for interleukin (CXCL) From the demonstrated no significant correlation with the Aβ content structures of CXCLactivated human CXCR in complex with (Fig SC) Interestingly, GNG levels were significantly reduced in trimeric G proteins (PDB code: LFO), we showed the resolved EVs derived from the brain tissues of pathological AD compared to binding sites of extracellular CXCL and found that CXCL binds to those in the NC group (Fig F) Thus, GNG expression may be the residue Arg of CXCR through residue Glu and Leu associated with Aβ production and the formation of Aβ plaques Sequence alignment of Aβ and CXCL protein revealed two in pathophysiological conditions highly similar sequences between Aβ and CXCL, which A total of cognitively normal participants (aged   included the above CXCRbinding amino acid residues (Fig G, years), patients with severe AD (aged   years), upper) Hence, we infer that Aβ could bind to the extracellular patients with moderate AD (aged   years), and patients region of CXCR, leading to CXCR activation and coupling to Gα with mild AD (aged   years) were included in this study, to , , with GNG release from Gα evaluate the variation in serum GNG levels at different clinical In addition, detailed structural comparison between CXCR stages of AD (Fig SD) In addition, a total of cognitively Aβ and CXCRGαi revealed overlapping of Aβ with Gαi at the normal participants (aged   years), patients with severe interface with CXCR The resolved binding sites of intracellular AD (aged   years), patients with moderate AD (aged Gαi (PDB: LFO) showed that Gαi binds to Arg of CXCR   years), and patients with mild AD (aged   through Cys, and Aβ binds to Arg of CXCR through years) were used to evaluate the variation in GNG level in serum Ala, indicating that Aβ competitively binds to the intracellular EVs at different clinical stages of AD (Fig G) There was no region of CXCR with Gαi (Fig G, lower)  Thus, we significant difference in sex composition ratio (p , hypothesized that Aβ could also bind to the intracellular region p ) among the groups The serum GNG levels in mild of CXCR and cause GNG to dissociate from CXCR AD (average   pgmL) were significantly lower than Totally, the computational study provided structure basis for those in moderate AD (average  , p < ), with no relationships of Aβ, CXCR, and G proteins Consistent with our significant differences between the other groups GNG in serum structure study, knockdown of CXCR (Fig SE) in oAβ EVs showed a nonsignificant, gradually decreasing trend in the stimulated T cells restored the enhancement of GNG proteins CN (average   pgmg), mild AD (average   pg to the level in WT group (Fig H) without altering the mRNA levels mg), moderate AD (average   pgmg), and severe AD (Fig SF) In addition, IF with Aβ demonstrated that GNG (average   pgmg) (Fig H) To further explain the overexpression significantly increased Aβ production relative to variation of GNG in EVs of AD patients, we enriched neuron the TAPPOE group While knockdown of CXCR in TAPPOE derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) from cognitively normal GNGOE cells did not significantly affect Aβ production participants (CN, aged,   yr), and patients with AD (aged, Cell Death and Disease () : C Li et al   yr) The WB results indicate that GNG levels are The above results indicated that GNG levels in the human significantly reduced in NDEVs from patients with AD (Fig SE) brain positively correlated with Aβ

ligand for TREM in microglia , to the To date, therapies targeting Aβ and tau proteins are the best of our knowledge, our research is the first to suggest that predominant treatments for AD, accounting for ~ of AD drug Aβ oligomers act as a ligand for CXCR in neuronal cells Aβ development  The FDA has approved six drugs for Aβ binding activate CXCR, facilitating the dissociation of Gproteins clearance Crucially, these drugs merely alleviate symptoms βγ from α subunits, activating downstream signaling pathways without altering the disease course Additionally, only three Protein structure predictions suggest that Aβ can bind to both monoclonal drugs, aducanumab, lecanemab and donanemab, extracellular and intracellular regions of CXCR which worth have emerged from discontinued drugs because of ineffec further indepth exploration CXCR is the receptor for CXCL The tiveness and toxic side effects; their efficacy remains under structures prediction and sequence alignment indicate that Aβ observation  In contrast, γsecretase inhibitors have been and CXCL competitively binds to the CXCR extracellular pocket extensively researched as potential AD treatments because of Thus CXCL could hinder the binding of Aβ to CXCR, which is their ability to inhibit Aβ production  However, Eli Lilly’s small consistent with previous report that CXCL protects human molecule γsecretase inhibitor, semagacestat, faced failure in neurons from Aβinduced neurotoxicity  Phase clinical trials because of adverse events such as skin In addition, humans express four distinct Gα subunits (Gαo, Gαi, cancer and infections  Meanwhile, gammasecretase modula Gαs, and Gαq), five Gβ subunits along with their variants (β, β, tors, such as SGSM and EVP, targeting the same enzyme, β, βS, β, β, and βL), and Gγ proteins (Gγ– and –), successfully reduce levels of the toxic Aβ peptide; however, which can potentially combine to form various heterotrimeric their use has also ceased in clinical trials ,  Moreover, to combinations in the cell membrane – Gβγ essentially date, no tautargeted treatments have shown definitive clinical functions as a single protein complex Individual Gβ or Gγ subunit efficacy in the preclinical or early stages of AD This trend is is unstable, and thus require dimerization to effectively perform expected to continue, as the monoclonal antibody Gosuranemab, their physiological functions  To our knowledge, this study aimed at the Nterminal tau protein in patients with earlystage reveals for the first time that GNG exists as an independent AD, failed to exhibit significant results in cognitive and functional homotrimer in the brain tissue and acts in this form as a hidden assessments  Therefore, considering the limited therapeutic regulator of Aβ production The molecular weights of Gα (o, i, s, options for AD, there is an urgent need to identify genes that q), Gβ (–), and Gγ (–, –) subunits have been explicitly modulate the early formation of Aβ peptides, particularly Aβ, stated as –, , and – kDa, respectively , , which and to inhibit oligomers derived from Aβ excludes the possibility that bands ≤ kDa are complexes formed The findings of this study indicate that GNG upregulation by GNG with α or β Thus, we propose that GNG in the human promotes the upregulation and activation of Rab, which brain can spontaneously assemble functional homooligomers, facilitates the production of Aβ by recruiting Rab to the whose abnormal elevation leads to a significant increase in Aβ membrane, leading to a significant increase in the number of early production, exacerbating AD pathology This finding also implies endosomes In the in vivo experiments, reducing GNG decreased that the β subunits and γ subunits might independently exhibit Aβ production and improved cognitive impairment in mice, molecular biological functions This insight provides a fresh suggesting that GNG could serve as a potential target for AD perspective for investigating Gproteins intervention Considering the advantages of EVs with high We propose that GNG is the upstream regulator of Aβ in the physicochemical stability and biocompatibility, low toxicity, and mechanism elucidated in this study Specifically, the elevated immunogenicity , using engineered EVs to deliver siRNA GNG levels in patients with AD lead to increased Aβ targeting GNG may represent a novel approach for AD production The augmented Aβ, in turn, further promote the intervention, distinct from direct Aβ clearance and γsecretase dissociation of GNG from CXCR, ultimately resulting in a vicious inhibition cycle and exacerbation of Aβ pathology Age is the greatest risk Notably, in the mechanism elucidated in this study, over factor for AD  The data of brain tissue EVs showed that GNG activated Rab can accelerate the transport and recycling of levels increased with age in both healthy and AD groups early endosomes However, Rab GTPases are inefficient However, this increase is more gradual in AD, although the enzymes with a low intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate and are thus difference was not statistically significant because of limited dependent on GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) to hydrolyze sample size (Fig SA) This finding suggests that aging bound GTP ,  Our data showed that GNG significantly exacerbates individual differences in the EVmediated clearance promoted Rab activation; hence, we speculate that GNG may of GNG in the brain This metabolic discrepancy may lead to an function as a GAP to accelerate the activation cycle of Rab accumulation of GNG in the brains of some individuals, causing The above data potentially account for the interesting out elevated Aβ levels This conclusion is further substantiated by comes in Fig F, wherein the heightened use of GNG, because our findings in three AD mouse models: APPswePSENdE, of a rapid endocytosis rate and activation cycling, leads to a FADT, and ×FAD These models demonstrated a definite notable decrease in GNG transported by EVs to the elevation in GNG levels within brain tissues, which was extracellular space associated with more pronounced Aβ deposition and heightened Cell Death and Disease () : C Li et al cognitive deficits (Figs , ) Conversely, no significant variation in the control To investigate the effects of GNG on amyloid GNG expression was detected in the brain tissues of young adult pathology and behaviors in vivo, each ×FAD mice were APPswePSENdE mice (twomonthold) that lacked Aβ plaque injected with mgkg EVRVG (control), mgkg GNG@EVRVG, formation (Fig SB, C) Therefore, both human brain tissue and and μg of siGNG@EVRVG Similarly, each FADT mice were animal model results indicate that GNG is the upstream regulator injected with mgkg EVRVG

Medical sources and utilize them for disease diagnosis Zhou et al Sciences Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals highlighted the urgent need to identify specific EV subtypes  Developing wellestablished strategies to identify and isolate Human brain tissue specific EV subtypes would advance EVs’ broad clinical applica All postmortem human brain tissues were obtained from the tions While, in this study, our data demonstrated that the National Human Brain Bank for Development and Function, reduction of GNG in neuronderived EVs in AD patients (Fig Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical SE) is consistent with the reduction of GNG observed in total College, Beijing, China Individuals were eligible for inclusion serumderived EVs in AD (Fig H) This suggests that detecting the based on the following criteria: () a definitive pathological reduction of GNG in serumderived EVs could distinguish AD diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or control (NC); () absence from CN and has the potential for early AD diagnosis without the of other CNS disorders except AD Donor information for each need for isolation and enrichment of neuronderived EVs experiment using human brain tissues is summarized in Table S In conclusion, our findings reveal that GNG upregulates Aβ Basic and detailed information for all the donors is provided in production by
