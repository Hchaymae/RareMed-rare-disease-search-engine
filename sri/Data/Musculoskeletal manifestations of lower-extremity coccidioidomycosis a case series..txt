Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection endemic to the southwestern United States Musculoskeletal manifestations are uncommon and seen in disseminated disease While the involvement of the axial skeleton has been well described the literature is limited on diseases involving the lower extremity Meth- ods: We identified three patients at two regional academic medical centers in southern Arizona who demon- strated different manifestations of osteoarticular coccidioidomycosis involving the lower extremity Results: Case is a -year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS and vertebral coccidioidomycosis who presented with abscesses in the left hemipelvis and left proximal femoral osteomyelitis He was treated with staged surgical de- bridement including the use of amphotericin B impregnated beads He remains on indefinite oral posaconazole suppression Case is a -year-old female who presented with suspected right knee osteoarthritis An MRI revealed septic arthritis and osteomyelitis Necrotic bone was debrided and synovial fluid cultures were posi- tive for Coccidioides She underwent a resection of the native knee joint with the insertion of an amphotericin B and voriconazole impregnated spacer She continues oral itraconazole and awaits a total knee arthroplasty Case is a -year-old male who presented with a draining right heel ulcer Radiographs revealed bony de- struction consistent with Charcot arthropathy Irrigation and debridement revealed the gelatinous destruction of the talus and calcaneus and cultures confirmed Coccidioides infection A polymethyl methacrylate voriconazole spacer was placed He subsequently underwent arthrodesis and remains on lifelong fluconazole Conclusion: Lower-extremity osteoarticular coccidioidomycosis has various debilitating presentations that frequently mimic non-infectious etiologies Treatment warrants surgical debridement and prolonged antifungal therapy should be considered Published by Copernicus
